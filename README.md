# mapped_data
A freeCodeCamp challenge creating a map of where meteorites have landed. 

# Working Application
https://codepen.io/mookh01/full/RLJrrL/

# Objective:
User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

# Challenges:
With this map I used the google map API and with that came a small learning curve from previous maps I've dealt with. I first had trouble with creating the circles properly. Many examples showed samples which were not brought in by JSON so getting the proper data became the biggest issue. 
The second issue I ran into was the InfoWindow. I had a similiar issue with finding the proper data, but figured out that calling the `map.data` became the key.
